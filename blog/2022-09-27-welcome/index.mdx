Welcome to Minecodes Blog!<br/>
I'm a student and software developer from Germany.<br/>
I'm currently working on a lot of projects, but also sometimes researching in cybersecurity and server administration.
I also started an project for finding, reporting and researching into spam or scam emails.<br/>
I started it, because some companies abuse contact emails on Github and send spam (it's illegal in Germany).

Also I work/worked at Minimania (Dev), VipeCity.net (Dev), TryGaming (Mod) and Entenrasten/Ententalk (Mod).<br/>
I created Minecraft plugins, Discord bots and other tools there.<br/>
I host multiple applications myself and try to make an own version of software.

I started to program in 2017 and I'm still learning new things.
I started with Scratch, then Python, JavaScript, C#, C / C++ (Arduino), Go, Rust, etc.
I also started in 2019 to be hosting own sites, tools or bots on Github, Gitlab or Raspberry Pis.
Some of them are still online and are maintained.
At the moment I'm not so active creating projects, because I don't have enough time, but when I have time again, I will go further and create new projects and versions of projects.
