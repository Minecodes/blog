A few days ago I received a friend request on Steam from an account I didn't know and asked them why they had sent me a request.
Today I received a message from this account. It was a phishing attempt to get my Steam account.
I looked into the site over an secured environment and looked at the site. It was a fake Steam login page.
I created an fake account and looked how the site works. The problem is it covers it's steps over it's own servers.
It's hosted on Cloudflare and had an .asia TLD. When I then registered with a fake account, it was taken over immediately.
I then had self-locked it because it was newly created anyway via a temporary email and I don't want that the owners of the site can do more with it.
I also wrote an report to steam. I hope they will take action against this site.
When you want to research into it you can do that with the documents in the link in the info box.
