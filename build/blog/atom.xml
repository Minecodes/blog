Author: Minecodes<br>

Documents: <a href="https://dl.minecodes.de/sec/phishing/steam/76561199075101489/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dl.minecodes.de/sec/phishing/steam/76561199075101489/</a></p></div></div><p>A few days ago I received a friend request on Steam from an account I didn't know and asked them why they had sent me a request.
Today I received a message from this account. It was a phishing attempt to get my Steam account.
I looked into the site over an secured environment and looked at the site. It was a fake Steam login page.
I created an fake account and looked how the site works. The problem is it covers it's steps over it's own servers.
It's hosted on Cloudflare and had an .asia TLD. When I then registered with a fake account, it was taken over immediately.
I then had self-locked it because it was newly created anyway via a temporary email and I don't want that the owners of the site can do more with it.
I also wrote an report to steam. I hope they will take action against this site.
When you want to research into it you can do that with the documents in the link in the info box.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Minecodes Blog!<br>
I'm a student and software developer from Germany.<br>
I'm currently working on a lot of projects, but also sometimes researching in cybersecurity and server administration.
I also started an project for finding, reporting and researching into spam or scam emails.<br>
I started it, because some companies abuse contact emails on Github and send spam (it's illegal in Germany).</p><p>Also I work/worked at Minimania (Dev), VipeCity.net (Dev), TryGaming (Mod) and Entenrasten/Ententalk (Mod).<br>
I created Minecraft plugins, Discord bots and other tools there.<br>
I host multiple applications myself and try to make an own version of software.</p><p>I started to program in 2017 and I'm still learning new things.
I started with Scratch, then Python, JavaScript, C#, C / C++ (Arduino), Go, Rust, etc.
I also started in 2019 to be hosting own sites, tools or bots on Github, Gitlab or Raspberry Pis.
Some of them are still online and are maintained.
At the moment I'm not so active creating projects, because I don't have enough time, but when I have time again, I will go further and create new projects and versions of projects.</p>]]></content>
